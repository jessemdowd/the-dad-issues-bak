Mary Spears is a working mom to three amazing kids and wife to Bret (he's amazing too). She delights in rap music, sweet dance moves, delicious food, and strong coffee.

## Eric Hall

#### Guest Author

Eric Hall is an Assistant Professor of Theology and Philosophy at Carroll College. When he's not busy teaching and writing, he's unequivocally trying too hard to reclaim his heritage as a Montanan (where his father was born) by boxing, wrestling, shooting, chopping wood, cooking for his family, and thinking up delightfully folkish colloquialisms for strangers who might accidentally set foot onto his property.\[/col\]\[/row\]
