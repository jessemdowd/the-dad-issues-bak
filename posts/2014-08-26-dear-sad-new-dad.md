This one is going to hurt a little bit. I DO NOT want to tell this story. I don’t want to be misunderstood (which I will). I don’t want to sound like a wiener (which I will). But, more than these, I don’t want anyone in my purview to suffer in isolation. So, here goes. **This is the story of what it felt like for me to become a father**:

It would probably be helpful to start at the beginning. What transpired the nine months before we attempted to conceive is most probably unique in its execution, but almost certainly all-too-common in its motivation- she was ready to have a baby and I wasn't. What this amounted to, in our household, was a 9-month consortium on all things procreative. We talked with friends. We talked with each other. We talked to our parents. We prayed. We went to see a marriage counselor. (At some point in time I will dedicate a piece to this time period) In the end (or, I suppose more fittingly, the beginning) a truckload of reflection, dialogue, and understanding won the day. I became resolved to join my wife in her desire to have a child.

\[lead\]And then the day came.\[/lead\]

I confess that it's all a blur. And not because I was indifferent to the process- I was a supportive, breath-counting, Sprite-fetching, cord-cutting husband. I can remember my first instinct when we got to the hospital was to go and get a mess of candy to keep in the room. I figured that if we had goodies for the taking then the nursing staff might visit more often. Thinking about this now from a Jungian perspective, it is kinda hilarious that my first act as a father was to bribe and manipulate the Others in a surreptitious effort to protect my own. For the record, it totally worked.

It was morning (I think) when judgment came upon us. We didn't know it at the time, but the cord had wrapped itself around Mary Grace's neck. As active labor intensified, we realized that something wasn't right. Each time a heavy contraction came on the cord became taut, causing MG's heartbeat to decelerate. The room filled with heart murmurs and looks askance. They told us, "We're gonna give you one push, but on the next one this baby has got to come out".  \[lead\]We pushed. They pulled. And, like a revelation, Mary Grace Spears. \[/lead\]

There is an age limit for a driver's license. There is a prerequisite score on the driver's examination. You are actually required by law to enter a business agreement with an insurance company who you will pay to vouch for you in case of an accident BEFORE you can register a vehicle. Not so for a baby. No, the criteria for taking into your care a barely-ensouled, Homosapien newborn is the presentation of an unexpired car seat. It doesn't even have to be yours. I left the hospital in a surreal haze.

\[lead\]In the months that followed, I experienced what some would call a roller coaster ride of emotions. I wouldn't call it that because I think roller coasters are fun.\[/lead\]

#### **1.**

I felt nothing. I can remember going to Mary about a week after we returned home from the hospital and saying, “I don’t feel any different”. I had expected the appearance of the child to be accompanied by a brilliant, blinding light from heaven that automatically uploaded the necessary fatherhood software, both the affection and aptitude, to my hard drive. It did not happen this way for me. _Instead, I felt disconnected from the new life that bore my image. Like a God who forgot why He created_. And, in turn, I felt guilty for feeling unaffected. And then angry for having to feel guilty. And then exhausted from feeling so much…

#### **2.**

I felt emasculated. I didn't know that was the appropriate word at the time. It was almost immediate. For me, there has always been a beneficial overlap between virility and vivacity. That symbiosis had quickly broken down. I felt sluggish. My libido waned. Even more worrisome than that, my normally slavish need to shoot hoops didn’t gnaw at me. I am not going to use the term “male post-partum depression” (mostly because Monica once mocked Chandler to scorn for claiming to suffer from its effects), but you can bet your ass that I googled it.

#### **3.**

I felt like all of the things I had feared came upon me swiftly. I had dragged my feet to have children because I was concerned that it would radically (and irresistibly) alter me, my relationship to my wife, and the liveliness of my friendships. Bing. Bang. Boom. I felt viscerally different. I felt disconnected from my wife in her joyous experience. The trouble with this, at this juncture, was that all of these changes were not yet contextualized by the deeper understanding and richness that would come along in the following months. Right then, it just felt like a cruel fate.

#### **4.**

I felt alone.  In the time leading up to the birth, countless friends and acquaintances assured me how much I would immediately love our new bundle of joy. I was told I could never imagine a love like the love I’d have for my child.  During her pregnancy, Mary made me watch unending episodes of “A Baby Story”.  Never in **any** episode did a father say or do anything but spew saccharine words of endless love for his new baby. I was left to wonder if these guys were just lying through their teeth or if I really was as isolated as I felt.

Now, I know that I haven’t offered any real hope here and that’s intentional on my part. I don’t want to paper over these feelings with quick-twitch how-to’s because I believe they matter and need some time to stand alone. But, in the next post I will spend some time talking about the ways we managed that season, a few of the lessons I learned, and some words of encouragement that I got from my urologist, of all people.
